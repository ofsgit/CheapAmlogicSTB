# CheapAmlogicSTB

**CheapAmlogicSTB** is a project for understanding, modifying, and extending-support on **cheap Amlogic-based set-top boxes (STBs)**.  
Amlogic Box exists because its cheap, and works.
This project has experiments, findings, hardware, and workflows related to cheap Amlogic devices often found in TV boxes, and in your garage;)

Have fun with your new box:)
