# CheapAmlogicSTB

**CheapAmlogicSTB** is a project for understanding, modifying, and extending-support on **cheap Amlogic-based set-top boxes (STBs)**.  
It exists for tinkerers, reverse engineers, and curious minds who want to squeeze more life out of inexpensive hardware.
This project has experiments, findings, hardware, and workflows related to cheap Amlogic devices often found in TV boxes, and in your garage;)
Have fun with your new box:)
